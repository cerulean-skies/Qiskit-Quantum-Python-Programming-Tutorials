# Qiskit-Quantum-Python-Programming-Tutorials
Quantum Information Science Kit - Learn to program a live Quantum Computer, stored and maintained, by the awesome team at IBM. 

Cerulean here, bringing you guys the latest developments in IBM's Quantum Programming Development. Though there are a number of teams working on their own quantum systems, I am a firm believer in what IBM is doing, and to even further advance their project, IBM has created several real life Quantum Computers, that they store and maintain in their research center. Furthermore, these machines are freely available to the public, through their web portal at https://IBM.experience.com (link not real yet), 24/7, so that anyone, anywhere who wants to learn how these machines operate, is free to do so. I personally think this is amazing, as otherwise you would have to have millions of dollars to operate one of these machines at this time.

### What is Quantum Computing?

Quantum Computers, are a rather new development in technology, and are still quite expiremental, though highly promising even at this stage. In a regular computer, we use bits to represent data, either a '1', or a '0'. Instead, in a quantum computer, researchers use what are known as 'Qubits' in the place of bits. Qubits, are able to represent either a '0', a '1', or 'both'. This, along with what is known as 'Quantum Entanglement', as well as the 'Superposition' concept, allow a quantum computer to solve complex algorithms in much a different, quicker way. As I have mentioned earlier, these computers are still highly in development, with researchers all over the world working daily towards their goal.(I am not a scientist, and have very little PC-Part knowledge, so I do suggest you look further into the mechanics of how these systems function, though I will do my best to elaborate here for you all.)

### What are Qubits?

Qubits, simply put, are Quantum Bits. Quantum computers rely on quite a few different quantum mechanics, and qubits are how we accomplish these feats. Qubits can be composed of a number of elemantal particles, from electrons to photons and more, however IBM has manufactured their own Qubit system, which are composed of several different super-conducting materials, and are controlled through RF waves. As mentioned above, Qubits can represent a state of 0, 1, or both at the same time. More will be explained in the next few paragrahs.

### What is Entanglement?
Entanglement, is an extremely strong bond between two Qubits. When qubits are entangled, one qubit can be examined lightyears away from the other, and they will always retain their bond. Flip a an entangled cubit facing up from down, and its partner wil react, no matter the distance. This is also being studied for high speed, long distance data comunication.

### What is Superposition?
Superpositon, is the ability for a qubit to be in both positions at once. For example, where a computer would have two bits, these bits can represent 00, 11, 01, and 10. In a quantum computer, 2 qubits can represent each of these states at one time, thanks to superposition.

### What will we be doing in these tutorials?

I will be doing my best to show you all how to get started using the Quantum Information Science Kit, to the best of my ability. I am not part of the IBM team in any way whatsoever, nor do I professionally program quantum computers. This is strictly a hobby of mine, and I hope that what I have to share will be interesting to you :)

### What will I need in order to follow along?
