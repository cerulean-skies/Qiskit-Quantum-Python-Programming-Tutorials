# Qiskit-Quantum-Python-Programming-Tutorials
Quantum Information Science Kit - Learn to program a live Quantum Computer, stored and maintained, by the awesome team at IBM. 

Cerulean here, bringing you guys the latest developments in IBM's Quantum Programming Development. Though there are a number of teams working on their own quantum systems, I am a firm believer in what IBM is doing, and to even further advance their project, IBM has created several real life Quantum Computers, that they store and maintain in their research center. Furthermore, these machines are freely available to the public, through their web portal at https://IBM.experience.com (link not real yet), 24/7, so that anyone, anywhere who wants to learn how these machines operate, is free to do so. I personally think this is amazing, as otherwise you would have to have millions of dollars to operate one of these machines at this time.

### What is Quantum Computing?

Quantum Computers, are a rather new development in technology, and are still quite expiremental, though highly promising even at this stage. In a regular computer, we use bits to represent data, either a '1', or a '0'. Instead, in a quantum computer, researchers use what are known as 'Qubits' in the place of bits. Qubits, are able to represent either a '0', a '1', or 'both'. This, along with what is known as 'Quantum Entanglement', allows a quantum computer to solve complex algorithms in much a different, quicker way. As I have mentioned earlier, these computers are still highly in development, with researchers all over the world working daily towards their goal.
